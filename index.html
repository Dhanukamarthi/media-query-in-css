    <p>A paragraph is a number of sentences grouped together and relating to one topic. Or, a group of related sentences that develop a single point.

        This definition shows that the paragraphs of compositions are not mere arbitrary divisions. The division of a chapter into paragraphs must be made according to the changes of ideas introduced.
